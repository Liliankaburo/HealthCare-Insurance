## Project Overview

This project analyzes healthcare insurance data to uncover trends, predict costs, and identify key factors affecting insurance premiums. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare costs are influenced by various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. This project aims to:

1. Explore relationships between variables and insurance charges.

2. Build a predictive model to estimate insurance costs.

3. Provide actionable insights for insurers and policyholders.


## Data Understanding

The  insurance.csv dataset includes features like:

1. ***Age: Age of the beneficiary***

2. ***Sex: Gender (male/female)***

3. ***BMI: Body Mass Index***

4. ***Children: Number of dependents***

5. ***Smoker: Smoking status***

6. ***Region: Residential area***

7. ***Charges: Individual medical costs***

## Technologies Used

a. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

b. Scikit-learn (Regression models, preprocessing)

c. Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and outliers.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features (e.g., BMI categories).

4. Model Building: Training regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

5. Evaluation: Metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

## Results & Insights

**Top 3 Factors Affecting Insurance Costs:**

1. Smoking status

2. Age

3. BMI

**Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor (R² = 0.87).

**Visualizations**: See assets/ for plots (e.g., cost vs. age, smoker/non-smoker comparison).
